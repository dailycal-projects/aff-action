        <p align='justify'>On July 21, UC Berkeley updated its reopening plans for the fall semester. According to the most recent announcement from the Division of Student Affairs, the campus will “begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction,” but hopes to switch to a hybrid model depending on public health conditions. Originally, UC Berkeley planned on starting the semester hybrid and shifting to a fully online model after Thanksgiving. To gain a better understanding of UC Berkeley’s reopening strategy, The Daily Californian compared UC Berkeley to other similar colleges and universities.
