      <div class="story">
        <p align="justify"><span class='dropcap'>F</span>or 25 years, Proposition 209 has banned the consideration of race in admissions at state institutions like UC Berkeley. On November 3, California’s voters will once again consider the question of affirmative action through the ballot proposition Proposition 16, also known as the Repeal Proposition 209 Affirmative Action Amendment. Proposition 16 is a constitutional amendment that would repeal California’s ban on affirmative action. If passed, the amendment would allow public universities like UC Berkeley to implement affirmative action programs within the bounds of federal law.</p>
        <p align="justify">On June 15, the UC Board of Regents endorsed Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5, the original version of Proposition 16. In a statement, Board Chair John Perez said, “I am proud UC endorsed giving California voters the chance to erase a stain, support opportunity and equality, and repeal Proposition 209.”</p>
        <p align="justify">UC Berkeley has struggled historically with enrolling a diverse student body. “On average, Black and Latinx students are underrepresented at selective colleges,” said Tolani Britton, an assistant professor of education at UC Berkeley. “Prop 209 also created a drastic underrepresentation of students of color...on the UC campuses.”</p>
        <p align="justify">The Daily Californian <a href="http://projects.dailycal.org/affirmative-action/">previously analyzed</a> affirmative action at UC Berkeley in 2016. In this article, The Daily Californian re-examines diversity on campus. Though Proposition 209 would enable colleges to consider affirmative action programs, a holistic approach to diversity is broader than merely admissions.</p>
        <p align="justify">“Admissions is one piece...but then you have to think about how the campus experience is like for students, particularly for students who are severely underrepresented,” Britton said. “How are you recruiting students?” We investigate every step of the college pipeline: application, admission and enrollment. We have restricted this article to incoming freshmen, though transfers are also a crucial part of diversity at UC Berkeley.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Applications</h4>
      <div class="story">

      <p align="justify">First, we examine applications. The number of applications signifies interest in UC Berkeley from graduating high school seniors. Below, we graph the number of applications to UC Berkeley by ethnicity from 1994 to 2019.</p>
      </div>
      <center>{% include "partials/line_app.html" %}</center>
      <div class="story">
        <p align='justify'>The plot shows applications steadily increasing across the board, though applications from African-American and Native-American students have mostly plateaued in the past decade. Asian-American students have shown the sharpest growth in applications, increasing by over 10,000 from 2012 to 2019.</p>
        <p align="justify">UC Berkeley has implemented new recruiting initiatives to boost applications from underrepresented areas. Programs like the Undergraduate Diversity Project, the African-American Initiative and the Hispanic Serving Institute Task Force emphasize outreach to high school counselors, scholarships for admitted students of color, and revamping admissions based on socioeconomic status. </p>
        <p align="justify">In an email, campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore said, “We believe our new efforts to improve diversity in outreach and recruitment are currently at the forefront among peer institutions.”</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Admissions</h4>
      <div class="story">
          <p align="justify">Next, we plot the admit rate of different ethnic groups from 1994 to 2019. Admit rates are the part of the college pipeline that administrators have the most direct control over.</p>
      </div>
      <center>{% include "partials/line_admit.html" %}</center>
      <div class="story">
          <p align="justify">After 1996, the year Proposition 209 was passed, the plot shows a sharp drop in admit rates for Native-American, African-American, and Latino students. Though admit rates have declined overall, African-American and Latino students fall significantly below other groups. </p>
          <p align="justify">Proposition 16 would reverse the effects of Proposition 209. Supporters argue that affirmative action is necessary to build a diverse student body and serve UC Berkeley’s mission as a public institution. Opponents of affirmative action argue that preferential treatment for African-American or Latino students would crowd out white or Asian students with stronger applications.</p>
          <p align="justify">A recent study by Zachary Bleemer argues against this claim. “The students who were pushed out of UC by Prop 209 benefited more from UC access than those who took their place,” said Bleemer. “(Black and Hispanic) students after Prop. 29 who lost access to UC campuses...ended up substantially worse off, on average, than expected for people moving between campuses.”</p>
          <p align="justify">The next chart compares UC Berkeley to other public universities based on the percentage of graduating high school seniors in the state from underrepresented groups and the percentage of incoming college freshmen from underrepresented groups.</p>
      </div>
      <center>{% include "partials/bubble.html" %}</center>
      <div class="story">
        <p align='justify'>UC Berkeley falls behind its peers in terms of diversity given California’s high school demographics. Other large public universities like UC Irvine and UT Austin have more diverse student populations, while Georgia Tech is similarly low in diversity compared to its in-state population.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Yield</h4>
      <div class="story">
        <p align="justify">Lastly, yield rates tell us whether students admitted choose to attend UC Berkeley.</p>
      </div>
      <center>{% include "partials/line_enroll.html" %}</center>
      <div class="story">
        <p align='justify'>Though yield rates have been highly variable, the past 5 years have seen a decline in yield from African-American and Native-American students. Admitted Latino and Asian students are now most likely to commit to UC Berkeley. In 2014, a decline in admit rates and a new way of placing applicants on waiting lists likely led to a spike in yields.</p>
        <p align="justify">Low yield rates from students of color may be due to a poor perception of UC Berkeley’s campus climate. “It’s not simply that the numbers (of underrepresented students) are low, it’s also the ways in which the campus provides itself as welcoming or not welcoming to students of color, especially low-income students of color,” said Britton. “I also think some of the legacy of Prop 209 has been...an understanding that these campuses are not necessarily welcoming for students of color.”</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Graduation rates</h4>
      <div class="story">
        <p align="justify">Even after coming to campus, inequities continue in the experience at college. Graduation rates demonstrate how many students go on to get their degree. Below, we show six-year graduation rates of different ethnic groups in both the entire UC system and UC Berkeley.</p>
      </div>
      <center>{% include "partials/line_grad_all.html" %}</center>
      </br>
      <center>{% include "partials/line_grad_berk.html" %}</center>
      <div class="story">
        <p align="justify">From the graphs, it is evident that UC Berkeley has higher graduation rates across the board, with the exception of African-American students.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Proposition 16</h4>
      <div class="story">
        <p align='justify'>
          In the recently admitted class of 2020, UC Berkeley made significant strides in diversity, admitting the most ethnically diverse freshman class in 30 years. Yet the UC Board of Regents has made it clear that they view affirmative action as a crucial part of holistic admissions.</p>
          <p align="justify">The past 25 years demonstrate the impact of Proposition 209 on California’s students. Soon, voters will need to decide the question of race-neutral admissions once again.</p>
